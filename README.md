# faprotax_db_edition

**“FAPROTAX_ed” is an edition of  FAPROTAX_1.2.3, the release of 2020, with additional 21 functions (November 2020) with up to 300 more taxa (from Species to Phylum, dependent on specificity) changing its role from having only cultivated data**

To be used with the FAPROTAX engine (Louca et al., 2016). For more details visit http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/louca/FAPROTAX.


It was amended with additional taxa and ecological roles based on cultured from ammendment of IJSEM database (Barberan, 2016), and by the mannual search for functional roles in publications of different levels of taxonomy (Phylum to Species) on  LPSN database (PARTE, 2018), MACADAM Explore (http://macadam.toulouse.inra.fr/), c) single function/gene searches in NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/), isolated genomes in MBDG database (http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/); b) cultured and uncultured taxa and references at SILVA database (YILMAZ et al., 2014); GLOSsary database (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2423-8), as well as the metagenome-assembled genomes at NCBI and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/about); d) search for taxa associated to key genes (which coded enzyme catalyzes first step of substrate degradation, or the final step of the compound production) in KEGG database of prokaryotes in KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?menu_type=pathway_maps&category=Prokaryotes) within prokaryotic energetic metabolic pathways (00195  Photosynthesis, 00196  Photosynthesis - antenna proteins, 00710  Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, 00720  Carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes, 00680  Methane metabolism, 00910  Nitrogen metabolism, 00920  Sulfur metabolism), lipid metabolism (hydrocarbon production in 00061  Fatty acid biosynthesis, 00073  Cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis, 00100  Steroid biosynthesis, 00120  Primary bile acid biosynthesis, 00121  Secondary bile acid biosynthesis, 00140  Steroid hormone biosynthesis, 01040  Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; hydrocarbon degardation in 00071  Fatty acid degradation), xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism (00362  Benzoate degradation, 00627  Aminobenzoate degradation, 00364  Fluorobenzoate degradation, 00625  Chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation, 00361  Chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene degradation, 00623  Toluene degradation, 00622  Xylene degradation
